Hi Mr. DeRuiter!
		I do have a couple of opinions regarding your class. This, as stated, is a Computer Science class. We definitely receive
	enough of the computer aspect of that, but relatively little exposure to the science part of it. A suggestion would be
	to go over new concepts in class, with the AP book. For example, students could be required to purchase an AP prep book,
	whether it be the Litvin or Barron's (I prefer the latter), and as we go over new concepts, such as ArrayLists, we could
	go over the corresponding sections in the AP book and do the prep problems. This would give us more practice with the
	types of problems we would see on the test in this class and the AP test in the future. As seen from the feedback
	relayed by your students, the free response portion of the AP test is easy and time-plentiful, partly because of the
	immense practice we receive in this class. However, the multiple choice section of the test is relatively more tricky,
	likely because of a lack of practice with running through code. 
		One thing I really liked about this class was how we went over the free response questions from old AP tests. The Litvin
	book did not adequately represent the nature and difficulty level of the AP test, but the questions we did in class did.
	The environment of the class is able to fuel collaboration on work days and institute a comfortable surrounding for work.
